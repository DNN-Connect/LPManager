        <b>1. Definitions</b></p>
    <p>
        The terms &quot;reproduce,&quot; &quot;reproduction,&quot; &quot;derivative works,&quot;
        and &quot;distribution&quot; have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright
        law.</p>
    <p>
        A &quot;contribution&quot; is the original software, or any additions or changes
        to the software.</p>
    <p>
        A &quot;contributor&quot; is any person that distributes its contribution under
        this license.</p>
    <p>
        &quot;Licensed patents&quot; are a contributor&#39;s patent claims that read directly
        on its contribution.</p>
    <p>
        <b>2. Grant of Rights</b></p>
    <p>
        (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
        conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
        worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare
        derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative
        works that you create.</p>
    <p>
        (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions
        and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
        royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer
        for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or
        derivative works of the contribution in the software.</p>
    <p>

        name, logo, or trademarks.</p>
    <p>
        (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim
        are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the
        software ends automatically.</p>
    <p>
        (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.</p>
    <p>
        (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do
        so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your
        distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object
        code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.</p>
    <p>
